In this project, I performed web scraping and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on real-world football match data to extract meaningful insights about team performance and match outcomes. I scraped structured match statistics from online sources, cleaned and transformed the raw data, and conducted detailed exploratory analysis using statistical techniques and visualizations.

The analysis focused on understanding relationships between key match indicators—such as goals scored, shots on target, and home vs away performance—and their impact on match results. Through visual and quantitative analysis, I identified patterns that explain how certain in-game metrics contribute to winning probability and overall team dominance.

This project demonstrates my ability to work with real, unstructured web data, handle missing and inconsistent values, and translate raw data into actionable insights using Python-based data analysis tools.
