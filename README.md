## Data Analysis of Football Match Performance Using Web-Scraped Data

### Project Overview:

This project focuses on collecting real-world football data through web scraping and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover meaningful insights about teams, players, and match-related statistics. The analysis focused on understanding relationships between key match indicators—such as goals scored, shots on target, and home vs away performance—and their impact on match results.
The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data analysis skills, starting from raw data extraction to visualization-driven insights.

### Project Files:

- [Web Scraping & EDA on Real Football Data.ipynb](Web%20Scraping%20%26%20EDA%20on%20Real%20Football%20Data.ipynb) – Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis

- **Data Source:** https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php – Original website from where the data was collected
  
### Objectives:

 - Scrape real football data from web sources

 - Clean and preprocess raw scraped data

 - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

 - Identify patterns, trends, and distributions in football data

 - Visualize insights using charts and graphs

### Tools & Technologies Used:

 - Python

 - Pandas – Data manipulation & cleaning

 - Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

 - Jupyter Notebook – Analysis workflow

### Data Collection:

 - Football data is scraped directly from online sources

 - Extracted information includes relevant football statistics such as Team / Player details, Match-related attributes & Performance metrics

 - Data is stored in structured tabular format for analysis

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

 - Handling missing values

 - Removing duplicates

 - Converting data types

 - Feature selection for analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1. Key analysis performed:

  - Descriptive statistics of football data

  - Distribution analysis of numerical features

  - Comparative analysis across teams / players

  - Trend identification using visualizations

2. Visualizations include:

  - Bar charts

  - Line plots

  - Histograms

  - Correlation plot

### Key Insights:

  - Identified performance patterns across different football entities

  - Observed trends and outliers in match statistics

  - Derived insights that can support decision-making in sports analytics

### Future Work:

This project can be further extended by transforming the exploratory analysis into actionable insights for football performance evaluation. Future work may include developing interactive dashboards using tools such as Power BI to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) like home advantage, goal conversion rates, disciplinary trends, and team-wise performance comparisons across seasons.

Additional analysis could focus on creating team-level KPIs, including average goals scored, goals conceded, shots on target efficiency, and disciplinary impact, to enable comparative performance benchmarking across leagues and seasons.

Segmenting the analysis by season, league, and match context (home vs away, half-time lead vs trailing) would provide deeper insights into tactical and situational performance trends.

Furthermore, automated data pipelines for periodic data updates and reporting could be implemented to support continuous monitoring of football performance metrics, making the analysis more scalable and suitable for real-world decision-making.

This analysis can also be extended by developing predictive models for match outcomes and goal scoring using machine learning techniques. Additional work could include team strength evaluation, expected goals estimation, and season-wise trend analysis to enhance predictive insights.
